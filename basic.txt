You should also mention what you would do if you happen to accomplish
your original goals early.





  2.	A list of the steps necessary to accomplish your project.
Break up the project into a sequence of stages. Where will
you start? What will you do next? What is the plan for finishing
this project? Give a step-by-step plan.
